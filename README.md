Forked from the original https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/loadtabonselect/

#### Description

LoadTabOnSelect prevents new tabs from automatically loading, instead loading them on selection.<br>
The intended usage of the addon is to facilitate power-users who open many tabs before viewing,<br>
but dislike auto-playing videos (and other annoyances).

This addon uses the WebExtensions API, and therefore fully supports Firefox 48+ (tested on Firefox ESR).

The only required permission is `tabs`.

As a bonus the extension "fix" google.* search links prefix.

#### Tips about:config

To background a page with ctrl set browser.tabs.loadInBackground to true.<br>
To background popup with ctrl set browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground to true.<br>
To background bookmarked links set browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground to true.<br>
